VectorSpaceDarkMatter.jl is the Julia implementation of the wavelet-harmonic integration method, designed for the efficient calculation of dark matter direct detection scattering rates in anisotropic detectors, and for arbitrary dark matter velocity distributions.

This package is a work-in-progress and is based on [the vsdm Python package](https://github.com/blillard/vsdm) in addition to the arXiv papers listed above.
